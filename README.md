# 🎬 CineMatch 2.0: AI-Powered Movie Discovery Platform

> **ITCS227: Introduction to Data Science & Artificial Intelligence**
> A production-grade streaming-style application delivering weighted statistical rankings, NLP semantic "vibe" search, and interactive 3D cinematic relationship mapping.

CineMatch 2.0 is an advanced content-based recommendation engine built with **Streamlit** and **Python**. It features a state-of-the-art AI core that transcends simple keyword matching to understand the "vibe" of cinema through high-dimensional embeddings and interactive network analysis.

## 🚀 Key Features (CineMatch 2.0)

### 🧠 AI Semantic "Vibe" Search
- Leverages **Sentence Transformers** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to perform natural language interpretation of movie plots and synopses.
- Search for "vibes" rather than just titles (e.g., *"lonely space travel"* or *"gritty urban survival"*).

### 🕸️ 3D Cinematic Discovery Explorer
- Interactive **Plotly 3D Network Graph** visualizing the relationships between 10,000+ movies.
- Explore movie clusters and "bridges" between genres in a dynamic 3D space.

### ⚖️ Weighted Statistical Ranking
- Implements the **IMDB Weighted Rating formula** to ensure global quality standards.
- Balances vote volume against average ratings to highlight objective "Viral Hits" and "All-Time Classics."

### 📂 Hybrid Watchlist Discovery
- Personalized recommendation engine that aggregates the "Cinematic DNA" of your entire watchlist.
- Discovers the perfect "next watch" by cross-referencing multiple movie affinities simultaneously.

### 🎨 Premium Cinematic UI
- **Glassmorphic Design**: Modern dark-mode interface with translucent cards and smooth transitions.
- **Dynamic Detail Panels**: Auto-navigating movie details that rise to the top for a seamless browsing experience.
- **Auto-Poster Discovery**: Multi-stage fallback system ensuring every movie has a visual poster, even for obscure titles.
